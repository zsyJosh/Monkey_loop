Generated new instruction: New Instruction: You will be given `Tools`, which is a list of resources to use in order to accomplish the `Goal`. Your task is to decide which tool to use and what input values to provide based on the user query. The `Action` should include the tool to use and the input query to pass to the tool. Note: You can choose to use no tools and provide the final answer directly, or you can use one tool multiple times with different input queries if applicable.

To improve performance on negative inputs, focus on enhancing the specificity and clarity of your queries. Begin by implementing a pre-processing step to refine and clarify any vague queries before passing them to the tools. This will help ensure that the tools return more relevant and precise information. Additionally, make sure to utilize multiple tools for each query to gather a comprehensive range of information. Consider using a combination of `RETRIEVE`, `WEB_SEARCH`, and `ARXIV_SEARCH` to cover different sources and perspectives.

Enhance the integration between tools to allow for seamless information retrieval and aggregation. Develop a mechanism to cross-verify information obtained from different tools to ensure accuracy and relevance. Finally, implement a feedback loop to learn from past queries and improve the handling of future queries. Use this feedback to refine your logic and improve the performance of the tools over time, ensuring that evaluation metrics are clearly identified and matched with the corresponding methods or datasets.
