Generated new instruction: New Instruction: You will be given `Tools`, which is a list of resources to use in order to accomplish the `Goal`. Your task is to decide which tool to use and what input values to provide based on the user query. Begin by implementing a decision-making framework to guide your tool selection. For academic queries, prioritize using ARXIV_SEARCH, while for broader or less specific queries, consider using WEB_SEARCH. This strategic approach will help ensure that the tool selection aligns with the query's requirements. Remember, you can opt to use no tools and provide the final answer directly if the query is straightforward.

In addition to selecting the appropriate tool, consider using multiple tools in sequence to cross-verify information and fill in any gaps that a single tool might miss. This combination of tools can lead to more comprehensive and accurate results. Before executing the action, introduce a query refinement step where you analyze and, if necessary, rephrase the initial query to better match the capabilities of the selected tool. This will help in structuring the queries more effectively, allowing the tools to return relevant and detailed information.

Finally, implement a feedback loop where you evaluate the results from the initial tool usage. If the results are unsatisfactory, consider using alternative tools or refining the queries further. This iterative process will help improve the performance on negative inputs, leading to more consistent and accurate outcomes. By following these guidelines, you can enhance the effectiveness of the tools and achieve the desired `Goal` more efficiently.

Generated new instruction: New Instruction: You will be given `Tools`, which is a list of resources to use in order to accomplish the `Goal`. Your task is to decide which tool to use and what input values to provide based on the user query. Begin by implementing a decision-making framework to guide your tool selection. For academic queries, prioritize using ARXIV_SEARCH, while for broader or less specific queries, consider using WEB_SEARCH. This strategic approach will help ensure that the tool selection aligns with the query's requirements. Remember, you can opt to use no tools and provide the final answer directly if the query is straightforward. 

To enhance the effectiveness of tool usage, introduce a query refinement step where you analyze and, if necessary, rephrase the initial query to better match the capabilities of the selected tool. This could involve breaking down complex queries into simpler components or rephrasing them for clarity. Additionally, consider using multiple tools in sequence to cross-verify information and fill in any gaps that a single tool might miss. This combination of tools can lead to more comprehensive and accurate results. Ensure that the logic for selecting tools is consistently applied, and develop a decision-making framework to guide tool selection based on the nature of the query.

Finally, implement a feedback loop where you evaluate the results from the initial tool usage. If the results are unsatisfactory, consider using alternative tools or refining the queries further. This iterative process will help improve the performance on negative inputs, leading to more consistent and accurate outcomes. By addressing these areas and following these guidelines, you can enhance the effectiveness of the tools and achieve the desired `Goal` more efficiently.

Generated new instruction: New Instruction: To effectively accomplish the `Goal` using the provided `Tools`, begin by carefully analyzing the user query to determine the most relevant tools and input values. It is crucial to diversify your tool usage by combining multiple tools, such as WEB_SEARCH and RETRIEVE, to gather comprehensive and cross-verified information. This approach ensures a broader search scope and enhances the accuracy of the results. When selecting tools, avoid over-reliance on a single tool like ARXIV_SEARCH, especially if it does not yield the desired results. Instead, be prepared to pivot to alternative tools or refine your queries to adapt to the information gathered.

Develop a dynamic query refinement process that adapts based on initial search results. Start with specific queries directly related to the task, and if the results are not satisfactory, consider using synonyms or related terms to refine your search. Leverage contextual information from the task description to form more precise queries, which can improve the relevance of the results. This adaptive strategy will help you avoid redundancy and ensure that your queries are specific and targeted, leading to more relevant and comprehensive data collection.

Incorporate a feedback mechanism into your process to learn from unsuccessful attempts. After each action, evaluate the effectiveness of the tool and query used, and adjust your future actions accordingly. This feedback loop will help you refine your approach over time, leading to more consistent and accurate task completion. By following these guidelines, you will enhance your ability to effectively use the tools provided and improve your performance on negative inputs.
