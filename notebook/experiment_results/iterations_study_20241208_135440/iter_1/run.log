Generated new instruction: New Instruction: To effectively accomplish the `Goal` using the provided `Tools`, begin by carefully analyzing the user query to determine its specificity and complexity. For broad queries, initiate the process with a combination of `WEB_SEARCH` and `RETRIEVE` tools to gather a wide array of information. Use specific keywords to refine the search results, ensuring that the gathered data is relevant and comprehensive. For queries requiring precise data, particularly academic or technical, prioritize the use of `ARXIV_SEARCH` to access detailed and authoritative sources. Always structure your queries to be specific and well-defined to enhance the precision of tool usage.

Incorporate an iterative approach in your workflow. Start with an initial action using the most suitable tool, then evaluate the output to determine if further refinement is needed. Use the results from one tool to inform the input for another, creating a feedback loop that enhances the search process. This iterative refinement is crucial for ensuring accuracy and completeness in the results. Avoid relying solely on a single tool or action; instead, explore multiple tools and iterations to verify and refine the information gathered.

Finally, consider the context and nuances of each query to select the most appropriate tool or combination of tools. If the tools do not yield satisfactory results, do not hesitate to provide a direct answer based on existing knowledge or inferred data. This approach ensures that even in the absence of tool-generated results, the user receives a comprehensive and accurate response. By following these guidelines, the group can significantly improve their performance on negative inputs, leading to more successful task completion.

Generated new instruction: To effectively accomplish the `Goal` using the provided `Tools`, begin by evaluating the nature of the user query to determine the most suitable tool or combination of tools. For broader queries, initiate the process with `WEB_SEARCH` to gather a wide range of information. This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of the topic, which can then be refined using more specific tools like `ARXIV_SEARCH` or `RETRIEVE` to delve into detailed insights. Ensure that your actions are exploratory and iterative, using multiple tools to cross-verify and ensure the completeness of the information retrieved.

Incorporate a dynamic decision-making process for tool selection. If the initial tool does not yield satisfactory results, implement a feedback loop to automatically try another tool or refine the query. This can involve using synonyms or related terms to increase the chances of retrieving relevant information. For instance, if `ARXIV_SEARCH` does not provide the necessary results, consider switching to `WEB_SEARCH` or `RETRIEVE`, or refining the query to better align with the available datasets. This iterative refinement should be a core part of your strategy, ensuring that each query is optimized for the best possible outcome.

Finally, consider integrating additional data sources or APIs that might offer more comprehensive datasets or evaluation metrics, particularly for specialized tasks. This could involve using niche-specific tools or databases that align with the task requirements, such as Few-Shot Image Classification or specific datasets like Vid4. By adopting these strategies, you can improve performance on negative inputs, leading to more consistent and reliable results across various tasks and datasets.
