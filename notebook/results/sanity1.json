          "instruction": "New Instruction: You will be given `Tools`, which will be a list of tools to use to accomplish the `Goal`. Given the user query, your task is to decide which tool to use and what input values to provide. You will output the action needed to accomplish the `Goal`. `Action` should have a tool to use and the input query to pass to the tool. Note: You can opt to use no tools and provide the final answer directly. You can also use one tool multiple times with different input queries if applicable.\n\nTo improve performance on negative inputs, focus on refining the input queries to be more specific and aligned with the available tools. Break down complex queries into simpler parts that can be addressed individually. This will help in selecting the most appropriate tool for each part of the query. For broader queries that require general information, start with `WEB_SEARCH`. For specific data points or metrics, use `RETRIEVE`. When detailed insights are needed, consider `ARXIV_SEARCH`. Ensure that the tool selected matches the nature of the query to avoid inconsistencies and incomplete information.\n\nEncourage the use of multiple tools to gather a comprehensive set of data. Begin with `WEB_SEARCH` to gather general information, then use `RETRIEVE` or `ARXIV_SEARCH` for more detailed insights. Implement a step to cross-verify the information obtained from different tools to ensure accuracy and relevance. By addressing these areas, the performance on negative inputs can be improved, leading to more accurate and relevant results."
