Generated new instruction: New Instruction: To effectively accomplish the `Goal` using the provided `Tools`, begin by carefully analyzing the user query to determine the most suitable tool for the task. Prioritize using the `RETRIEVE` tool for queries that require specific information from relevant sources, as it has proven to yield accurate and comprehensive results. Ensure that your queries are well-structured and targeted, incorporating specific terms related to the task, such as "evaluation metrics" or "performance metrics," to enhance the precision of the data retrieved. 

When dealing with broader queries or when the required information is not directly available in the dataset, consider using the `WEB_SEARCH` tool. However, be mindful of the tool's limitations and refine your queries to be as specific as possible to avoid irrelevant or incomplete information. If the initial query does not provide satisfactory results, adopt an iterative approach by refining and re-submitting the query based on the output received. This method will help in narrowing down the search to more relevant results and improve the overall effectiveness of the tool usage.

Additionally, employ a strategy of cross-verification by using multiple tools to confirm the accuracy and reliability of critical data points, such as highest scores or specific dataset evaluations. This practice will ensure that the information obtained is both accurate and comprehensive. By following these guidelines and maintaining consistency in tool selection and query formulation, the group's performance on negative inputs can be significantly enhanced, leading to more accurate and relevant outputs.
