As the key and value are the same in this case , this is identical to a standard MemNN and this approach has been used in several papers .\n",
      "paragraph : Window Level Documents are split up into windows of words ; in our tasks we only include windows where the center word is an entity . Windows are represented using bag - of - words . Window representations for MemNNs have been shown to work well previously . However , in Key - Value MemNNs we encode the key as the entire window , and the value as only the center word , which is not possible in the MemNN architecture . This makes sense because the entire window is more likely to be pertinent as a match for the question ( as the key ) , whereas the entity at the center is more pertinent as a match for the answer ( as the value ) . We will compare these approaches in our experiments .\n",
      "subsection : Transition System Given an input , most often a sentence , we define : A set of states . A special start state . A set of allowed decisions for all . A transition function returning a new state for any decision . We will use a function to compute the score of decision in state for input . The vector contains the model parameters and we assume that is differentiable with respect to . In this section , for brevity , we will drop the dependence of in the functions given above , simply writing , , , and . Throughout this work we will use transition systems in which all complete structures for the same input have the same number of decisions ( or for brevity ) . In dependency parsing for example , this is true for both the arc - standard and arc - eager transition systems , where for a sentence of length , the number of decisions for any complete parse is . A complete structure is then a sequence of decision / state pairs such that , for , and . We use the notation to refer to a decision sequence . We assume that there is a one - to - one mapping between decision sequences and states : that is , we essentially assume that a state encodes the entire history of decisions . Thus , each state can be reached by a unique decision sequence from . We will use decision sequences and states interchangeably : in a slight abuse of notation , we define to be equal to where is the state reached by the decision sequence . The scoring function can be defined in a number of ways . In this work , following chen - manning:2014:EMNLP , weiss - etAl:2015:ACL , and zhou - etAl:2015:ACL , we define it via a feed - forward neural network as Here are the parameters of the neural network , excluding the parameters at the final layer . are the final layer parameters for decision . is the representation for state computed by the neural network under parameters . Note that the score is linear in the parameters . We next describe how softmax - style normalization can be performed at the local or global level .\n"

      "Generated new instruction: New Instruction: You will be given `Tools`, which is a list of resources available to accomplish the `Goal`. Your task is to carefully select the most appropriate tool for each user query and determine the specific input values to provide. When deciding on an `Action`, ensure it includes the chosen tool and the input query tailored to the task. Remember, you can choose not to use any tools and provide the final answer directly if it is more efficient. Additionally, you may use a tool multiple times with different input queries if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "To enhance your performance, focus on precise tool selection and query formulation. Begin by conducting a preliminary analysis of the query to determine its specificity and relevance to the available tools. For example, use `ARXIV_SEARCH` when detailed academic information or specific paper IDs are required, and opt for `WEB_SEARCH` for broader queries. Ensure that your queries are specific and directly related to the task, structured to retrieve the most pertinent information. This will help in obtaining relevant and complete results, improving the overall evaluation scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adopt an iterative approach by refining your initial query based on the results obtained. This method allows you to narrow down the search to more relevant information. Additionally, cross-verify the information obtained from different tools to ensure accuracy and completeness. This practice will help identify any discrepancies and refine your search further, leading to more consistent and successful outcomes across various tasks. Implement a mechanism to break down complex queries into simpler components or rephrase them based on initial feedback, enhancing the decision-making process and ensuring the logic for tool selection aligns with the nature of the query.\n",
