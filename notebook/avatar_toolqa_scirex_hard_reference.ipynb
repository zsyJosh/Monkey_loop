As the key and value are the same in this case , this is identical to a standard MemNN and this approach has been used in several papers .\n",
      "paragraph : Window Level Documents are split up into windows of words ; in our tasks we only include windows where the center word is an entity . Windows are represented using bag - of - words . Window representations for MemNNs have been shown to work well previously . However , in Key - Value MemNNs we encode the key as the entire window , and the value as only the center word , which is not possible in the MemNN architecture . This makes sense because the entire window is more likely to be pertinent as a match for the question ( as the key ) , whereas the entity at the center is more pertinent as a match for the answer ( as the value ) . We will compare these approaches in our experiments .\n",
      "subsection : Transition System Given an input , most often a sentence , we define : A set of states . A special start state . A set of allowed decisions for all . A transition function returning a new state for any decision . We will use a function to compute the score of decision in state for input . The vector contains the model parameters and we assume that is differentiable with respect to . In this section , for brevity , we will drop the dependence of in the functions given above , simply writing , , , and . Throughout this work we will use transition systems in which all complete structures for the same input have the same number of decisions ( or for brevity ) . In dependency parsing for example , this is true for both the arc - standard and arc - eager transition systems , where for a sentence of length , the number of decisions for any complete parse is . A complete structure is then a sequence of decision / state pairs such that , for , and . We use the notation to refer to a decision sequence . We assume that there is a one - to - one mapping between decision sequences and states : that is , we essentially assume that a state encodes the entire history of decisions . Thus , each state can be reached by a unique decision sequence from . We will use decision sequences and states interchangeably : in a slight abuse of notation , we define to be equal to where is the state reached by the decision sequence . The scoring function can be defined in a number of ways . In this work , following chen - manning:2014:EMNLP , weiss - etAl:2015:ACL , and zhou - etAl:2015:ACL , we define it via a feed - forward neural network as Here are the parameters of the neural network , excluding the parameters at the final layer . are the final layer parameters for decision . is the representation for state computed by the neural network under parameters . Note that the score is linear in the parameters . We next describe how softmax - style normalization can be performed at the local or global level .\n"

The improvement is more significant than the results on the image data , this maybe due to differences between datasets .

      "section : CONCLUSION In this paper , we use deep learning technology to solve the single image super - resolution problem . We first propose a dilated convolution based inception module , which can learn multi - scale information from the single scale input image . We design a deep network , which cascades multiple dilated convolution based inception modules , for single image super - resolution . Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms many state - of - the - art ones . As future work we plan to explore MSSRNet for video processing .\n",

    "For the optimization of the `Actor` we'll be using `AvatarOptimizer`. It's a DSPy implementation of the [Avatar](https://github.com/zou-group/avatar/) method that optimizes the `Actor` for the given `tools` using a comparator module that optimizes Actor instruction. Note, that Actor is the Module that directs tool execution and flow, it's not the signature that we are passing. It doesn't optimize the instruction of the signature we pass. It takes the following parameters:\n",

      "Generated new instruction: To effectively accomplish the `Goal` using the provided `Tools`, begin by carefully analyzing the user query to determine the most appropriate tool for the task. Retain the flexibility to use no tools if the answer can be directly provided. When selecting a tool, prioritize specificity in your queries. For instance, when using the `RETRIEVE` tool, ensure that your queries are precise and directly related to the task, incorporating specific keywords or phrases that are likely to appear in the relevant sections of papers or datasets. This will enhance the relevance and accuracy of the outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In cases where the `RETRIEVE` tool does not yield satisfactory results, consider broadening your approach by utilizing `WEB_SEARCH` or `ARXIV_SEARCH`. These tools can provide a wider context or access to more specific information that might not be covered by the `RETRIEVE` tool. This strategic selection of tools will help in accessing a diverse range of information sources, thereby improving the quality of the outputs. Additionally, implement an iterative query refinement process. Analyze the initial results, refine the query based on the relevance of the output, and repeat this process to hone in on the most pertinent information.\n",

      "Finally, employ a cross-verification strategy to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information obtained. Use multiple tools to verify the data; for example, if `RETRIEVE` provides partial information, use `WEB_SEARCH` to fill in any gaps or confirm the details. This approach will not only improve the performance on negative inputs but also ensure that the outputs are comprehensive and directly answer the questions posed. By following these enhanced guidelines, the group can achieve more accurate and relevant results, thereby improving their overall performance on the task.\n",
