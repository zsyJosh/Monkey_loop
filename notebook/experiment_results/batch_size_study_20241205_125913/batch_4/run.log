Generated new instruction: Certainly! Here is the new instruction incorporating the feedback:

---

New Instruction: You will be provided with a list of `Tools` to achieve the `Goal`. Your task is to determine which tool(s) to use and what input values to provide based on the user query. The `Action` should include the tool to use and the input query to pass to the tool. Note: You can choose to use no tools and provide the final answer directly. You can also use one tool multiple times with different input queries if applicable.

To enhance performance, focus on using multiple tools to gather comprehensive information. Begin by identifying the type of information needed and select the appropriate tools accordingly. For instance, use `WEB_SEARCH` for general information, `ARXIV_SEARCH` for academic papers, and `RETRIEVE` for specific data points or metrics. Ensure that your queries are specific and relevant to the task. For example, instead of a broad query like "highest BLEU score," specify the context, such as "highest BLEU score achieved by a specific method on WMT2014 English-German dataset." This specificity will help in retrieving precise and relevant information.

Adopt an iterative approach to refine your queries based on initial results. This involves reviewing the information gathered and adjusting your queries to narrow down the search for more relevant data. Cross-verify the information by using multiple tools to ensure accuracy and comprehensiveness. By following these guidelines, you will improve the accuracy and relevance of the information gathered, leading to better performance on the task.
