Generated new instruction: To effectively accomplish the `Goal` using the provided `Tools`, begin by carefully analyzing the user query to identify any vague or incomplete elements. Implement a pre-processing step to refine these queries by adding context or related terms, ensuring they are specific and detailed. This will enhance the precision of the search results. When formulating your `Action`, consider using multiple tools in sequence or parallel, even for initial vague queries. This strategy increases the likelihood of retrieving comprehensive and relevant information. For instance, start with a broad search using WEB_SEARCH or ARXIV_SEARCH, and then use RETRIEVE to gather more specific data based on initial findings.

Incorporate a feedback loop into your process. If the initial search does not yield satisfactory results, prompt for more details or clarify the query. This iterative approach will help refine the search and improve the relevance of the results. Additionally, consider integrating more specialized databases or repositories into your toolset. These sources may contain niche or less common datasets and methods, providing a broader range of information to draw from. This integration will enhance your ability to handle diverse queries effectively.

Retain the flexibility to opt for no tools and provide the final answer directly when the query is straightforward and the information is readily available. However, ensure that the logic for handling queries is robust, utilizing multiple tools to cross-verify and gather comprehensive information. By following these enhanced strategies, you will improve performance on negative inputs, leading to more consistent and reliable results across all queries.

Generated new instruction: New Instruction: You will be given `Tools`, which is a list of resources to use in order to accomplish the `Goal`. Your task is to determine which tool to use and what input values to provide based on the user query. The `Action` should include the tool to use and the input query to pass to the tool. Note: You can choose to use no tools and provide the final answer directly if the information is readily available. You can also use one tool multiple times with different input queries if applicable.

To improve performance on negative inputs, incorporate a strategy of using multiple tools in sequence to gather comprehensive information. Begin with ARXIV_SEARCH to obtain academic insights and follow up with WEB_SEARCH to gather practical applications or additional context. This approach ensures cross-verification and a more complete understanding of the topic. If the initial search does not yield satisfactory results, refine and iterate on your queries by including synonyms or related terms. This iterative process will help in uncovering more relevant information.

Additionally, implement a fallback mechanism to try alternative tools or queries if the initial attempt does not provide satisfactory results. For example, if ARXIV_SEARCH does not yield results, switch to WEB_SEARCH, or vice versa. In cases where tools do not provide the necessary information, consider providing a direct answer based on existing knowledge or inferred from partial data. By following these guidelines, you can ensure more consistent and accurate results across different queries, improving performance on negative inputs.

Generated new instruction: New Instruction: You will be given `Tools`, which is a list of resources to use in order to accomplish the `Goal`. Your task is to determine which tool to use and what input values to provide based on the user query. The `Action` should include the tool to use and the input query to pass to the tool. Note: You can choose to use no tools and provide the final answer directly if the information is readily available. You can also use one tool multiple times with different input queries if applicable.

To enhance performance on negative inputs, adopt a strategy of sequential tool usage to ensure comprehensive information gathering. Begin with ARXIV_SEARCH to obtain academic insights, then follow up with WEB_SEARCH to gather practical applications or additional context. This approach allows for cross-verification and a more complete understanding of the topic. If the initial search does not yield satisfactory results, refine and iterate on your queries by including synonyms or related terms. This iterative process will help uncover more relevant information and improve the quality of the results.

Additionally, ensure that the logic for selecting tools is flexible and adaptive. Implement a fallback mechanism to try alternative tools or queries if the initial attempt does not provide satisfactory results. For example, if ARXIV_SEARCH does not yield results, switch to WEB_SEARCH, or vice versa. In cases where tools do not provide the necessary information, consider providing a direct answer based on existing knowledge or inferred from partial data. By following these guidelines, you can ensure more consistent and accurate results across different queries, thereby improving performance on negative inputs.
