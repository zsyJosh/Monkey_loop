Generated new instruction: Certainly! Here is the new instruction incorporating the feedback:

---

**New Instruction:** You will be given `Tools`, which is a list of tools to use to accomplish the `Goal`. Given the user query, your task is to decide which tool to use and what input values to provide. You will output the action needed to accomplish the `Goal`. The `Action` should include a tool to use and the input query to pass to the tool. Note: You can opt to use no tools and provide the final answer directly. You can also use one tool multiple times with different input queries if applicable.

To improve performance on negative inputs, it is crucial to diversify tool usage and implement a dynamic, iterative approach. Begin by using `WEB_SEARCH` to gather general information, and then refine your search with `ARXIV_SEARCH` for more specific academic insights. This combination allows for a comprehensive understanding of the topic. Ensure that you adapt your strategy based on the initial results; if the first tool does not yield satisfactory results, modify your query or switch to another tool to leverage its strengths. This dynamic logic will help in refining the search process and avoiding irrelevant or repeated queries.

Additionally, incorporate a feedback loop where the results from one tool inform the input for the next. This iterative query refinement will help narrow down the search to more relevant results. Use different tools to cross-verify information, ensuring accuracy and comprehensiveness. Cross-verification is particularly useful when initial results are ambiguous or incomplete. By following these guidelines, you can significantly improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of your results, leading to better performance on negative inputs.
