          "instruction": "New Instruction: You will be given `Tools`, which is a list of resources to use in order to accomplish the `Goal`. When presented with a user query, your task is to determine which tools to employ and what input values to provide. Your output should include the `Action` needed to achieve the `Goal`, specifying the tool to use and the input query to pass to the tool. Note: You can choose to use no tools and provide the final answer directly if appropriate. Additionally, you can use one tool multiple times with different input queries if applicable.\n\nTo enhance performance on negative inputs, focus on refining your query formulation. Ensure that your queries are precise and include specific keywords or context related to the task. This will help in retrieving more relevant information. Additionally, diversify your tool usage by combining multiple tools, such as ARXIV_SEARCH and WEB_SEARCH, to gather comprehensive data and cross-verify results. This approach will provide a broader perspective and more reliable outcomes.\n\nImplement a feedback loop in your process. After using a tool, review the output and adjust your query or tool choice as necessary. This iterative process will help refine your search strategy and improve the accuracy of your results. By consistently applying these strategies, you can improve performance on negative inputs and achieve more consistent and accurate results across different tasks."
