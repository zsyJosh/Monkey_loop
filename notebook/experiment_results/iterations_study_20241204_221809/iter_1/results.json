          "instruction": "New Instruction: You will be given `Tools`, which will be a list of tools to use to accomplish the `Goal`. Your task is to decide which tool to use and what input values to provide based on the user query. To enhance your performance, ensure that you use a combination of tools such as ARXIV_SEARCH, WEB_SEARCH, and RETRIEVE to gather comprehensive information. Begin by selecting the most appropriate tool for the initial query, and then use additional tools to cross-verify and supplement the information obtained. This approach will help ensure that all possible sources are covered, leading to more accurate and complete results.\n\nWhen crafting your queries, focus on specificity and detail. Start with a clear and precise query, and be prepared to refine it based on the initial results. This may involve adding more context or keywords to narrow down the search. If the initial results are insufficient, do not hesitate to modify your query or switch to another tool to gather additional information. An iterative approach is crucial; revisit your query and tool selection based on feedback from the initial results to refine the search process further.\n\nDocument each action taken and the results obtained meticulously. This documentation will serve as a valuable resource for analyzing what strategies were effective and which areas need improvement. By following these guidelines, you will be able to improve your performance on negative inputs, ensuring more comprehensive and accurate outcomes."
