              "instruction": "New Instruction: To effectively accomplish the `Goal` using the provided `Tools`, begin by carefully analyzing the user query to determine its specificity and complexity. For broad queries, initiate the process with a combination of `WEB_SEARCH` and `RETRIEVE` tools to gather a wide array of information. Use specific keywords to refine the search results, ensuring that the gathered data is relevant and comprehensive. For queries requiring precise data, particularly academic or technical, prioritize the use of `ARXIV_SEARCH` to access detailed and authoritative sources. Always structure your queries to be specific and well-defined to enhance the precision of tool usage.\n\nIncorporate an iterative approach in your workflow. Start with an initial action using the most suitable tool, then evaluate the output to determine if further refinement is needed. Use the results from one tool to inform the input for another, creating a feedback loop that enhances the search process. This iterative refinement is crucial for ensuring accuracy and completeness in the results. Avoid relying solely on a single tool or action; instead, explore multiple tools and iterations to verify and refine the information gathered.\n\nFinally, consider the context and nuances of each query to select the most appropriate tool or combination of tools. If the tools do not yield satisfactory results, do not hesitate to provide a direct answer based on existing knowledge or inferred data. This approach ensures that even in the absence of tool-generated results, the user receives a comprehensive and accurate response. By following these guidelines, the group can significantly improve their performance on negative inputs, leading to more successful task completion."
