Generated new instruction: I'm here to help you craft the new instruction based on the feedback provided. Here's a suggested version:

---

New Instruction: You will be given `Tools`, which is a list of resources to use in order to accomplish the `Goal`. Your task is to decide which tool to use and what input values to provide based on the user query. To enhance your performance, ensure that you select the most appropriate tool for each specific query. For instance, use ARXIV_SEARCH for queries related to specific academic papers and WEB_SEARCH for broader informational needs. Consider using multiple tools in sequence to gather comprehensive information, especially for complex queries. This approach will help you cross-verify and ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information gathered.

Refine your input queries to be more specific and targeted. This can be achieved by using additional keywords or phrases that are likely to be present in the desired information. By doing so, you will improve the relevance of the results retrieved. Additionally, implement a feedback loop to learn from past queries. Analyze unsuccessful queries to understand what went wrong and how it can be corrected in future attempts. This continuous improvement process will enhance your ability to select the right tools and formulate effective queries.

Finally, ensure that you cross-verify the information obtained by using multiple tools. Compare results from different sources to identify the most reliable information. This practice will help you provide a well-rounded and accurate response to the user query. Remember, you can opt to use no tools and provide the final answer directly if the information is already known or straightforward. You can also use one tool multiple times with different input queries if applicable. By following these guidelines, you will improve your performance on the task and achieve the desired outcomes more effectively.

Generated new instruction: New Instruction: You will be given `Tools`, which is a list of resources to use in order to accomplish the `Goal`. Your task is to decide which tool to use and what input values to provide based on the user query. To enhance your performance, ensure that you select the most appropriate tool for each specific query. For instance, use ARXIV_SEARCH for queries related to specific academic papers and WEB_SEARCH for broader informational needs. Consider using multiple tools in sequence to gather comprehensive information, especially for complex queries. This approach will help you cross-verify and ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information gathered.

To improve performance on negative inputs, focus on refining your input queries to be more specific and targeted. Incorporate additional keywords or phrases that are likely to be present in the desired information, such as the dataset name, task, and evaluation metric. For example, instead of a general query like "highest score method Atari Games," specify the dataset and metric, such as "highest Medium_Human-Normalized_Score on Atari-57 dataset for Atari_Games." This will enhance the relevance of the results retrieved. Additionally, implement a feedback loop to learn from past queries. Analyze unsuccessful queries to understand what went wrong and how it can be corrected in future attempts. This continuous improvement process will enhance your ability to select the right tools and formulate effective queries.

Finally, ensure that you cross-verify the information obtained by using multiple tools. Compare results from different sources to identify the most reliable information. This practice will help you provide a well-rounded and accurate response to the user query. Remember, you can opt to use no tools and provide the final answer directly if the information is already known or straightforward. You can also use one tool multiple times with different input queries if applicable. If the initial query does not yield satisfactory results, refine and iterate the query with different keywords or phrases. By following these guidelines, you will improve your performance on the task and achieve the desired outcomes more effectively.

Generated new instruction: New Instruction: You will be given `Tools`, which is a list of resources to use to accomplish the `Goal`. Your task is to decide which tool to use and what input values to provide based on the user query. Begin by implementing a pre-processing step to interpret and refine the query, breaking it down into simpler components if necessary. This will help in aligning the query with the most suitable tools. For specific queries related to academic papers or datasets, prioritize using the `ARXIV_SEARCH` and `RETRIEVE` tools. These tools are effective for gathering precise information. Use the `WEB_SEARCH` tool for broader queries only when necessary, ensuring that the query is as specific as possible to improve the precision of the results.

Develop a nuanced strategy for tool selection by considering the specificity and nature of the query. For instance, if the query is about a well-documented dataset or method, use `ARXIV_SEARCH` or `RETRIEVE` to gather information and confirm it with a `WEB_SEARCH` if needed. For less common or broad queries, refine the query to make it more specific or consider expanding the data sources available to the tools. This could involve integrating additional databases or APIs that specialize in niche areas relevant to the queries, thereby improving the chances of retrieving accurate information.

Introduce a feedback loop to learn from past queries and results, enhancing future tool selection and query handling. This adaptive approach can be achieved through machine learning techniques, allowing the system to refine its strategy based on success rates. By incorporating these strategies, you can improve performance on negative inputs, leading to more consistent and accurate results across a wider range of queries.

Generated new instruction: New Instruction: You will be given `Tools`, which is a list of resources to use to accomplish the `Goal`. Your task is to decide which tool to use and what input values to provide based on the user query. Begin by implementing a more robust pre-processing step to interpret and refine the query, breaking it down into simpler components if necessary. This will help in aligning the query with the most suitable tools. For specific queries related to academic papers or datasets, prioritize using the `ARXIV_SEARCH` and `RETRIEVE` tools. These tools are effective for gathering precise information. Use the `WEB_SEARCH` tool for broader queries only when necessary, ensuring that the query is as specific as possible to improve the precision of the results.

To enhance performance on negative inputs, integrate additional databases or APIs that specialize in niche areas relevant to the queries. This could involve partnerships with academic institutions or leveraging open data initiatives, thereby expanding the data sources available to the tools. Develop a more nuanced strategy for tool selection by considering the specificity and nature of the query. For instance, if the query is about a well-documented dataset or method, use `ARXIV_SEARCH` or `RETRIEVE` to gather information and confirm it with a `WEB_SEARCH` if needed. For less common or broad queries, refine the query to make it more specific or consider expanding the data sources available to the tools.

Introduce a feedback loop to learn from past queries and results, enhancing future tool selection and query handling. This adaptive approach can be achieved through machine learning techniques, allowing the system to refine its strategy based on success rates. Additionally, provide users with guidance on how to structure their queries to improve the chances of retrieving accurate information. This could involve suggesting keywords or query structures that align well with the available tools. By incorporating these strategies, you can improve performance on negative inputs, leading to more consistent and accurate results across a wider range of queries.
