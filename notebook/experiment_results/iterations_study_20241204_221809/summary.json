Your task is to decide which tool to use and what input values to provide based on the user query. To enhance your performance, ensure that you select the most appropriate tool for each specific query. For instance, use ARXIV_SEARCH for queries related to specific academic papers and WEB_SEARCH for broader informational needs. Consider using multiple tools in sequence to gather comprehensive information, especially for complex queries. This approach will help you cross-verify and ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information gathered.\n\nTo improve performance on negative inputs, focus on refining your input queries to be more specific and targeted. Incorporate additional keywords or phrases that are likely to be present in the desired information, such as the dataset name, task, and evaluation metric. For example, instead of a general query like \"highest score method Atari Games,\" specify the dataset and metric, such as \"highest Medium_Human-Normalized_Score on Atari-57 dataset for Atari_Games.\" This will enhance the relevance of the results retrieved. Additionally, implement a feedback loop to learn from past queries. Analyze unsuccessful queries to understand what went wrong and how it can be corrected in future attempts. This continuous improvement process will enhance your ability to select the right tools and formulate effective queries.\n\nFinally, ensure that you cross-verify the information obtained by using multiple tools. Compare results from different sources to identify the most reliable information. This practice will help you provide a well-rounded and accurate response to the user query. Remember, you can opt to use no tools and provide the final answer directly if the information is already known or straightforward. You can also use one tool multiple times with different input queries if applicable. If the initial query does not yield satisfactory results, refine and iterate the query with different keywords or phrases. By following these guidelines, you will improve your performance on the task and achieve the desired outcomes more effectively."
