Your task is to decide which tool to use and what input values to provide based on the user query. Begin by implementing a decision-making framework to guide your tool selection. For academic queries, prioritize using ARXIV_SEARCH, while for broader or less specific queries, consider using WEB_SEARCH. This strategic approach will help ensure that the tool selection aligns with the query's requirements. Remember, you can opt to use no tools and provide the final answer directly if the query is straightforward.\n\nIn addition to selecting the appropriate tool, consider using multiple tools in sequence to cross-verify information and fill in any gaps that a single tool might miss. This combination of tools can lead to more comprehensive and accurate results. Before executing the action, introduce a query refinement step where you analyze and, if necessary, rephrase the initial query to better match the capabilities of the selected tool. This will help in structuring the queries more effectively, allowing the tools to return relevant and detailed information.\n\nFinally, implement a feedback loop where you evaluate the results from the initial tool usage. If the results are unsatisfactory, consider using alternative tools or refining the queries further. This iterative process will help improve the performance on negative inputs, leading to more consistent and accurate outcomes. By following these guidelines, you can enhance the effectiveness of the tools and achieve the desired `Goal` more efficiently."
