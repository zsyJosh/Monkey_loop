Generated new instruction: To effectively accomplish the `Goal`, you will be provided with a list of `Tools` to utilize. Your task is to strategically select the appropriate tools and formulate precise input queries to achieve the desired outcome. Begin by considering a combination of tools such as `ARXIV_SEARCH`, `WEB_SEARCH`, and `RETRIEVE` to gather comprehensive information. This approach ensures a broader scope of data collection, enhancing the quality of your results. Remember, you can use a tool multiple times with different input queries if necessary, and in some cases, you may opt to provide the final answer directly without using any tools.

To improve performance on negative inputs, focus on refining your query strategy. Formulate specific and detailed queries by including key terms such as dataset names, specific metrics, and task descriptions. This specificity will help in retrieving more relevant and accurate information. Employ multiple queries to refine and cross-verify the data gathered, ensuring that you cover all necessary aspects of the task. An iterative search process is recommended, where you analyze initial outputs to identify any gaps or missing information and adjust your queries accordingly.

Lastly, consider the direct provision of answers when the information is straightforward and well-known, bypassing tool usage if it leads to a more efficient resolution. By implementing these strategies, you will enhance your ability to handle negative inputs effectively, resulting in more accurate and comprehensive outcomes.
