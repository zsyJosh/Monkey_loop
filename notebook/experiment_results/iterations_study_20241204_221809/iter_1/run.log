Generated new instruction: To effectively accomplish the `Goal` using the provided `Tools`, begin by prioritizing the use of the `RETRIEVE` tool for queries that are likely to have specific answers in academic papers or datasets. This tool should be your first choice for extracting detailed and relevant information. For more general queries or when the `RETRIEVE` tool does not yield satisfactory results, consider using the `WEB_SEARCH` tool. Ensure that your decision-making process for selecting tools is consistent and based on the specificity and relevance of the query to the available data.

Before using any tool, implement a query refinement step to ensure that the input queries are as specific and relevant as possible. Break down complex queries into simpler sub-queries that can be addressed individually, which will help in obtaining more precise results. This approach will also aid in identifying the most appropriate tool for each sub-query, thereby improving the overall effectiveness of the task execution.

Incorporate a fallback mechanism where, if the initial tool does not provide satisfactory results, an alternative tool or method is automatically employed. This could involve rephrasing the query or using a different tool to cross-verify the information. Additionally, introduce a feedback loop to evaluate the results of the tool usage. Adjust the tool selection logic based on the success or failure of previous actions, potentially using machine learning techniques to learn from past interactions and improve future tool selection and query handling.
