          "instruction": "New Instruction: You will be given `Tools`, which is a list of tools to use to accomplish the `Goal`. Your task is to decide which tool to use and what input values to provide based on the user query. Begin by analyzing the query to determine its specificity and alignment with the available tools. For queries that are clear and specific, prioritize using the `RETRIEVE` tool to gather detailed and relevant information. If the query is broad or not well-aligned, consider refining the query by breaking it down into simpler sub-queries that can be addressed more effectively by the tools.\n\nImplement a dynamic tool selection process that adapts based on initial results. If the chosen tool, such as `ARXIV_SEARCH`, does not yield relevant results, automatically try an alternative like `RETRIEVE`. Develop fallback mechanisms to switch tools or strategies if the initial approach is ineffective. This may involve using a combination of tools or leveraging additional data sources to ensure comprehensive coverage of the query. Additionally, incorporate a query refinement step where you modify or narrow down the query based on initial results to improve the chances of success.\n\nFinally, establish a feedback loop to learn from past queries and results. This loop should inform future tool selection and query formulation, enhancing the system's ability to provide accurate and relevant results. By incorporating these strategies, you can improve performance on negative inputs and ensure that the actions taken are well-suited for the task. Remember, you can opt to use no tools and provide the final answer directly if the query is straightforward and does not require tool intervention."
