Implement a pre-processing step to refine these queries by adding context or related terms, ensuring they are specific and detailed. This will enhance the precision of the search results. When formulating your `Action`, consider using multiple tools in sequence or parallel, even for initial vague queries. This strategy increases the likelihood of retrieving comprehensive and relevant information. For instance, start with a broad search using WEB_SEARCH or ARXIV_SEARCH, and then use RETRIEVE to gather more specific data based on initial findings.\n\nIncorporate a feedback loop into your process. If the initial search does not yield satisfactory results, prompt for more details or clarify the query. This iterative approach will help refine the search and improve the relevance of the results. Additionally, consider integrating more specialized databases or repositories into your toolset. These sources may contain niche or less common datasets and methods, providing a broader range of information to draw from. This integration will enhance your ability to handle diverse queries effectively.\n\nRetain the flexibility to opt for no tools and provide the final answer directly when the query is straightforward and the information is readily available. However, ensure that the logic for handling queries is robust, utilizing multiple tools to cross-verify and gather comprehensive information. By following these enhanced strategies, you will improve performance on negative inputs, leading to more consistent and reliable results across all queries."
