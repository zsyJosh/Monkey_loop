Generated new instruction: New Instruction: To effectively accomplish the `Goal` using the provided `Tools`, begin by carefully analyzing the user query to determine its specificity and relevance to the available tools. For queries that are clear and specific, select the most appropriate tool, such as ARXIV_SEARCH for academic papers or WEB_SEARCH for broader information. When dealing with complex or multifaceted queries, employ a combination of tools to gather comprehensive information. For instance, start with ARXIV_SEARCH to find relevant papers, then use WEB_SEARCH to gather additional context, and finally, use RETRIEVE to consolidate and verify the information obtained.

Ensure that your input queries are refined and targeted. This involves using precise keywords that are directly related to the evaluation metrics or datasets in question. By doing so, you increase the likelihood of retrieving relevant and accurate results. If the initial tool does not yield satisfactory results, be prepared to refine your query or switch to an alternative tool. This iterative process of query refinement and tool selection is crucial for addressing vague or broad queries effectively.

In cases where the initial results are incomplete or irrelevant, implement follow-up actions. This could involve using RETRIEVE to gather additional context or background information that can aid in understanding the results from other tools. Always consider using multiple tools in sequence to cross-verify information and ensure comprehensive coverage of the query. By adopting these strategies, you can improve the performance on negative inputs, leading to more accurate and relevant outcomes.
