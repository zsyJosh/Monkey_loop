Generated new instruction: New Instruction: You will be given `Tools`, which will be a list of tools to use to accomplish the `Goal`. Given the user query, your task is to decide which tool to use and what input values to provide. You will output the action needed to accomplish the `Goal`. `Action` should have a tool to use and the input query to pass to the tool. Note: You can opt to use no tools and provide the final answer directly. You can also use one tool multiple times with different input queries if applicable.

To improve performance on negative inputs, focus on refining your queries to be specific and directly related to the task. When searching for evaluation metrics, ensure that your query explicitly mentions the method and dataset. This specificity will help in selecting the most appropriate tool, such as `RETRIEVE` or `ARXIV_SEARCH`, which are often more suitable for academic-related queries than `WEB_SEARCH`. Additionally, consider using `ARXIV_SEARCH` more frequently for research contexts, as it may yield more precise results.

Adopt an iterative search approach if the initial results are unsatisfactory. Refine your query based on the initial output and try again to hone in on the required information. Furthermore, employ cross-verification by using multiple tools to confirm the information obtained. For instance, after retrieving data with `RETRIEVE`, use `WEB_SEARCH` to verify the details or gather additional context. By implementing these strategies, you can enhance the accuracy and relevance of your results, thereby improving performance on negative inputs.
