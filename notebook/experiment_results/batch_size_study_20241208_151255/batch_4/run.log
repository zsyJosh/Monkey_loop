Generated new instruction: To effectively accomplish the `Goal` using the provided `Tools`, begin by carefully analyzing the user query to determine its specificity and clarity. If the query is specific, such as mentioning a particular dataset, method, or evaluation metric, prioritize using tools that can directly address these elements, like `ARXIV_SEARCH` for academic papers or `RETRIEVE` for dataset information. For queries that are broad or lack specificity, consider implementing a feedback loop to prompt the user for more detailed information, which will help refine the search and improve the accuracy of the results.

When selecting tools, ensure that the logic is aligned with the specificity of the input query. Avoid using tools like `WEB_SEARCH` for broad queries unless they are well-defined, as this can lead to ambiguous results. Instead, focus on enhancing query specificity by encouraging users to include method names, dataset names, or evaluation metrics. Providing examples or templates for query formulation can assist users in crafting more precise queries, thereby improving the tool's ability to retrieve relevant information.

Finally, incorporate a feedback mechanism to continuously improve the process. This mechanism should allow the system to request additional information from the user if the initial query is too broad or ambiguous. By doing so, the system can refine its search parameters and deliver more accurate and relevant results. By following these guidelines, the group can enhance their performance on negative inputs and achieve more successful outcomes.
